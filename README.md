# Horiseon-Challenge

I did this challenge for my bootcamp. 

This html file was just full of div elements. 

The first element we changed was to a header element. For the top of the website. We also added alt to the img to describe what the img is.
we also added a div class hero for the css file. 
Next, we changed the next div section to a main parent and switch within that element child element of section. Also, changed id/class names for the css file. 

Instead of adding another main for the next div. We set that as an aside element to help with the css file not getting confused with another main element. Within that we also switched the div to section and added alt to each img. Also, adding in comments to each section with in the html file. 

The css file we condensed down some of the selectors and added in comments. This helps so there isnt as many repeating selectors and containers.
